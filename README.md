A collection of small projects I have done.

<h2> Effectiveness of Marketing Campaigns </h2>

<p>
This was a small project I did during my internship.
  
I was tasked with anaysising the effectivness of various marketing campaigns. The campaigns involved sending targeting reminders to select customers at specific times. I was given the database containing the relevant customber segments, which I then merged, using python, with the customer data for all purchases during specific times. I used the new merged data set to visialise, in Tableau, the volume of sales over time for various campaigns.

I was able to conclude which campaign was the most effective, thus assisting the marketing team in deciding where to focus their time and budget.

<h2> Account Manager Performance </h2>

<p>
This was a small Tableau project I did during my internship.
  
I was tasked with anaysising the performance of select account managers from the last calander year. I used Tableau to visual the profits over time. 

I was to highlight the performance trend of each account manager and compare them to one another. This allowed the sales managers to determine which account manager was able to out perform the market's dip.
